# Planning

This repository is my roadmap on the way of becoming a self-taught web developer. This roadmap will consist of many different disciplines working together in harmony, so I strongly suggest you examine this repository and only adopt what you think will benefit you in the long term. 

Project-specific plannings:

- [Custom LMS with an Express.js/Node.js back-end, a MongoDB Database, and a React.js/Redux Front-end](https://github.com/gpfaucher/planning/blob/master/projects/LMS.md)
